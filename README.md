Extract Text From Videos using Python

In machine learning, Speech recognition is an interesting task that allows you to recognize the text behind the audio. With the use of voice recognition, we can also extract text from a video.

We will take you through how to extract text from a video using Python. The first step is to download a video. After downloading the videos we need to install two Python libraries:

1) SpeechRecognition: pip install SpeechRecognition 
2) moviepy: pip install moviepy
After installing the above two Python libraries we can start with coding.
